1. I would not use a unit test on the "message" feature of a messaging application because it likely has many moving parts, or in other words it depends on many other components such as message input and sending mechanisms. This is one of the cons described in the writeup.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because it is an isolated functionality in the code that could be easily verified and is not impacted by changing other features in the app.
